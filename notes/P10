//LeetCode Problem 10 - Regular Expression Matching

Pseudocode
1. Parse both strings
    2. if both match, 
            move to next character in string and pattern
       else 
            return false
    3. else if pattern's current character is *
                if pattern's previous character matches 
                    then stay on with same pattern character
                else 
                    move to next pattern character
                move to next string character
    4. else if pattern's current character is .
                if following character is *
                    then check characters after * match with string. // can pass recursively to same function to match with                     
                else
                    continue to next character in pattern and string
